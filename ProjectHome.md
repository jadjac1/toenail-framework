**Toenail** is a small framework consisting of a few Cocoa controls that I have written, which I think may be useful to others.

Currently there are only two controls available, but I hope to add more in the future:

  * **TATreePopUpButton:** an extension of `NSPopUpButton` that displays a hierarchical menu instead of a flat list. It can use either an `NSTreeController` or a data source to obtain its data.
  * **TAFontField:** a read-only text field that allows the user to select a font using the standard system font panel, displaying the name and size of the font in the font itself. It is functionally similar to the font selection control in Safari's preferences.

Bugs and known issues can be found on the **Issues** page.
